This is the Matlab implemention of four auditory saliency models. The Kayser model's code is the original code developed by its author. Other three models are
implemented by Xiansong Xiong, one of the graduate students in our CUC-Acoustics team.

All codes are implemented in Matlab, version R2019a.

In each folder, the main function can be run to obtain the saliency map of the audio. The main functions in each folder are as follows:

1. The main function in the folder "2005-Kayser" is "Example_saliency.m".
2. The main function in the folder "2007-Duangudom and Anderson" is "Duangudom_Saliency.m".
3. The main function in the folder "2007-Kalinli and Narayanan" is "Kalinli_Saliency.m".
4. The main function in the folder "2012-Kaya and Elhilali" is "Kaya_Saliency.m".
